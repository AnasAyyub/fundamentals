# Introduction to SQL

SQL is a language for interacting with databases.

It is a declarative language, which means that you tell the database what you want, and the database figures out how to get it. 

We will be using MySQL where the syntax is slightly different from other SQL databases, but the concepts are the same.

1. Show all databases

```sql

```

2. Create a database

```sql

```

3. Create a database only if it doesn't exist

```sql

```

4. Delete a database

```sql

```

5. Delete a database only if it exists

```sql

```

6. Use a database

```sql

```

7. Show all tables

```sql

```

8. Create the table `batches` with a primary key `id` and a `name` column

```sql

```

9. Create the table `students` with a primary key `id`, a `name` column, a `batch_id` column as a foreign key to the `batches` table
```sql

```

10. Delete the table `students`

```sql

```
