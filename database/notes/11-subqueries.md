## Sub-queries

> A subquery is a SQL query nested inside a larger query.
> A subquery is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.


You can use a sub-query in a SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement to perform the following tasks:

* Compare an expression to the result of the query.
* Determine if an expression is included in the results of the query.
* Check whether the query selects any rows.
  
A sub-query may occur in :
* A SELECT clause
* A FROM clause
* A WHERE clause

There are a few rules that sub-queries must follow âˆ’

* Sub-queries must be enclosed within parentheses.
* A sub-query can have only one column in the SELECT clause, unless multiple columns are in the main query for the sub-query to compare its selected columns.
* An ORDER BY command cannot be used in a subquery, although the main query can use an ORDER BY.
* Sub-queries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators such as the IN operator.
* The BETWEEN operator cannot be used with a subquery. However, the BETWEEN operator can be used within the subquery.

Let us consider the `students` table below

| id  | first_name | last_name | batch_id | iq  |
| --- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | John       | Watson    | 1        | 120 |
| 2   | Mycroft    | Holmes    | 1        | 160 |
| 3   | Moriarty   | Patel     | 2        | 160 |


Now, we want all the students who are greater than the average IQ.
We can compute the average IQ using the `AVG` function but the aggregated value can not be used within the WHERE clause. So, let us try to use a sub-query.

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name, last_name, iq
FROM
    students
WHERE
    iq > (SELECT 
            AVG(iq)
        FROM
            students);
```

This would first compute the average IQ of all the students and then compare the average IQ to the IQ of the current student. Since the sub-query returns a single value, it can be used in the WHERE clause without any special handling.

Let us modify the original query to see an example where the sub-query returns multiple values.
We want all the students who have IQs greater than the students of batch_id 2;

One way to handle this query is to use the MAX function to get the highest IQ of the batch_id 2 students.

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    students
WHERE
    iq > (SELECT 
            MAX(iq)
        FROM
            students
        WHERE
            batch_id = 2);
```

Another way would be to use the `ALL` keyword. ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    students
WHERE
    iq > ALL (SELECT 
            iq
        FROM
            students
        WHERE
            batch_id = 2);
```

### Correlated Sub-queries

> A correlated subquery (also known as a synchronized subquery) is a subquery (a query nested inside another query) that uses values from the outer query. Because the subquery may be evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, it can be slow.


> Correlated subqueries are used for row-by-row processing. Each subquery is executed once for every row of the outer query.

![Sub-queries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/SQL_Correlated_Subqueries.png)

A correlated subquery is one way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against related data. It is used whenever a subquery must return a different result or set of results for each candidate row considered by the main query. 

In other words, you can use a correlated subquery to answer a multipart question whose answer depends on the value in each row processed by the parent statement.

#### EXISTS operator
The EXISTS operator tests for existence of rows in the results set of the subquery. If a subquery row value is found the condition is flagged TRUE and the search does not continue in the inner query, and if it is not found then the condition is flagged FALSE and the search continues in the inner query.
